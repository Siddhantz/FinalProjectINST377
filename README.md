Fire Stations in PG county
The target browser is anything on PC, whether it's chrome, edge, etc but it works well with mobile as well. Both ios and android.

Description of your project:
The Api used for this was the fire stations dataset from the PG county database, the exact api is:
https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/bzf2-94qx.json
My visualization has a map that shows all the Fire stations in PG county and allows you to filter through them based on type
No CSS frameworks were used, only things we covered in class such as flexbox, etc. Everything that's core CSS and nothing else.
My actual problem is trying to display all the fire stations in PG county and allowing you to filter through them and the problem it's solving is basically you being able to visualize the dataset that already existed. If you were a county official deciding where to open a new fire station, you could use my visualization and see where they exist so far and think of where to open a new one. The problem it's solving is basically showing numerical data in an appealing visual.
